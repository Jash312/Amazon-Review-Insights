But when I take it home and use it on wood floor than it slips. If I put it on a fluffy rug in my room, it bunches up weird under my feet and slips. If I  put it on the tiles in my basement, it slips and slides and even stretches as I do yoga and push out with my hands into planks and chaturanga.It’s very annoying. So there’s really only one place I’ve not minded using this mat.Now, it is pretty thick and soft, so if all you’re doing is stretching on it slowly, or on your knees or butt that’s fine. But you start doing a vinyasa flow and the dang thing shifts all over the place. It also looks like crap really quick too. I am not hard on it at all, and it’s gotten dings and dents in it somehow.I gave it 2 stars for its squishiness.  But it’s basically useless for me due to its being so slippery on most of my home surfaces.It is also not very “grippy” on the top for sticking my feet and hands in yoga poses. I had a huge gorilla mat a long time for working out on. It’s not portable, but that thing is amazing, with grip and steadiness on hard surfaces.So I am going to try to find a portable mat like that bc this one is just not doing it for me!!',\n",

However, in the last couple of months, it's started to flake while I use it to the point where my hands are covered in  blue by the time I finish my workout. I also find it hard to do exercises that involve balance because of the extra cushioning (maybe that's a bonus if you're looking for an extra challenge?), and it does tend to stretch during exercises like planks and lunges where friction from the floor is important. Overall, I would say the extra cushioning sounds great, but isn't in practice.\",\n",

Scoliosis has caused issues for me working out on the traditional yoga mats because they have no give and it feels like working out on hard wood flooring. Kneeling exercises were impossible for me without folding a towel or putting a pillow down. This mat does not have that issue and has just enough cushion to not send my back or knees spiraling. The material is a bit cheaper than a traditional yoga mat and I've noticed that less than a week in it already has a small divit into the material but that could also maybe be from my dog's nails when she assumed I was rolling out a new bed for her.This mat probably won't last as long as my other one but it has enough give that I'll purchase again.\",\n",

So I am not doing super intense exercises, mostly beginner courses made for larger people. A few positions have caused damage to the mat. I'm not sure what it's called but its when you make a mountain top with your body with your butt in the air- and then you go into a lunge. That one had my feet digging into the mat and the skin under my toes actually got hurt when I slid on the mat, trying to gently change my position into a lunge. It didn't break the mat all the way though.While I am sure this was because of the weight I'm dealing with, I specifically bought this mat because it was meant for people who need more cushion like myself.I feel for anyone smaller than me, this would be the ideal yoga mat, however. So if you are not a larger person, definitely buy this mat. It's great for first time use, otherwise! I recommend getting a yoga pillow though.\",\n",
