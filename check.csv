2019-02-21,Get what you pay for - they’re okay,3.0,"You get what you pay for. These will do the job but they are mediocre knives and not that well made. Not very sharp. Board is okay. But given the price, they are okay.",0,Ease of use

2019-04-22,Pretty but Not very durable.,3.0,"The red one is strong and holding it's own. However, the purple one broke the first time I used it to cut a cantaloupe",0,Size
2019-07-17,Purchased for RV,2.0,"The cutting board is of expected quality and am happy with it. One of the knives (the purple one) has already started to break at the handle. It appears that the blades do not go all the way through the handle and with the handles being plastic, the blade broke through the top of the handle under pressure after only a couple of outings and will likely be unusable in a couple more uses. I would not buy this product again. Will simple replace each as they break with a better brand.",0,Size
2019-11-20,Not dishwasher safe,2.0,"This are nice knives and look great. However I put one in the dishwasher and the white went a little yellow. They are sharp now, but I am not sure how well they can be sharpened with the black paint. They don't fit perfectly into the covers, especially the tiny knife. The board is a practical size, and is staying white even with daily use.I reduced the review - after 6 months ALL the whites of the knives are a definite yellow! One knife came out it's handle, but was glued back.",1,Size
2019-12-13,No good,2.0,They are useless I was hoping to get sharp knives . They are extremely dull,1,Color
2019-12-20,"Not as advertised, used not new",2.0,"What I liked was they were supposed to come with protective covers &  a cutting board plus color variety seemed really nice, what I didn't like is that I think I got a used set . The cutting board was very scratched up & actually looked ""used"", there was no sharpener included which was supposed to be part of the set, there  were no covers on all the knives except for the 2 large ones & they ARE very sharp, it wasn't easy to realize the covers were gone as they are the same color as the knives until we washed them & got cut, so be careful when you open them to be sure there are covers on every knife, quite  frankly I think I got a ""used set"", not new because the condition just didn't look new, plus all the scratches on the cutting board just looked like it had been used, other than that It would have been a really good buy. Basically what it comes down to is I think I got a previously owned set instead of new. I donated them to the Salvation Army. They are non-refundable item.",1,Sharpness

2019-12-21,Good gift set for brand new kitchen users with no other knives,2.0,"I don't like the color. I prefer a bright stainless steel knife look. I can see using these being a safety hazard in low lighting or with inexperienced cooks - because the knife itself is actually black in color. the handle is black and white. These are not a set I'd want for myself, but can see them as a good gift item for brand new cooks or college kids wanting to cook. The cutting board is very, very small. I haven't used it enough to comment, other than to say it's only skid proof when used on the underside. So, the eatneat logo that displays on the drip side/juice grooves is totally useless. lol  I don't understand that. Quite odd, since you need the juice grooves when using ANY cutting board. :-/ Have not used the sharpener.  Protective sheathes are good idea, but mine are in black like the knife blade.... another safety hazard. Transaction with seller was fine. No problems there. It's just that the product does not meet my requirements nor expectations in a kitchen. Will update if I find anything else. The item I ordered was : EatNeat 12-Piece Black Sharp Knife Set: 5 Stainless Steel Kitchen Knives with Covers, Cutting Board and Sharpener. Maybe the more ""colorful"" sets are better to prevent safety issues? Idk.",1,Ease of use

2020-10-29,Inconsistent Quality and Hard to Clean,3.0,"The product arrived in a nice package, each knife looked very cool coming out of the box with its black blade and safety cover.  The first knife I tried was razor sharp, I was slicing tomatoes super thin with ease.  While slicing the tomatoes, I ran into the first issue...  The handle stains.The handles are white and black, the white part started turning red as I sliced the tomato.  When I noticed the stain, I quickly ran the knife under running water, then scrubbed the handle and the stain was still there.  The stain is would not come out.  I even put it through a dishwasher, nothing worked.The next issue is the inconsistency of the sharpness of the blades.  The first blade I tried was super sharp out of the box.  The second, was sharpish.  The third, well I would have had better luck slicing with a brick.  I don't mind sharpening a blade when it needs it, but when I buy I knife it needs some sort of edge.

The handle of my chef's knife is permanently stained orange from the amount I use it, especially on carrots, which isn't great but expected. The knives and their covers are good to just drop in a drawer instead of having a knife rack. I would advise you NOT TO GIFT THIS SET, as it looks very generic and mass-produced (with a little bit of factory residue that washes off with a good preliminary cleaning and sharpening) and definitely won't impress your uncle or mom.

This is a good option for a small kitchen with limited space and has a cutting board included that slides nicely into an integrated pocket that makes for overall compact and good use of space.The knives themselves are probably fine for someone that doesn't really care about knife quality which is most people, I think.  They are light and seem decently balanced.  The honing rod (incorrectly referred to as a sharpener) is terrible however.  It has very aggressive grooves but mine is rife with imperfections that when attempting to use properly (I collect and restore knives and know how to use a honing rod), the knives bite in to the rod.  It is completely unusable. If I were rating this just on the rod it would be a generous 1 star.  So too bad that an otherwise thoughtfully designed set includes this piece of junk.

2023-01-08,Very appealing set,4.0,"This is actually a great change from your basic butcher block of knives. This set sits against the wall instead of sticking out. Every thing is easy to access and having a cutting board right there as well is nice. It looks good, is heavy sturdy pieces, has plenty of choices, sharp and overall, seems well constructed. I do wish it had scissors but that's ok. I first tried the pairing knife because I use those mostly and have trouble finding ones I like. Most pairing knifes designed like these just don't work well for my needs but to my surprise, I was able to peel apples and potatoes with no issues. This knife is sharp enough to glide through the peelings with little waste and that is a huge plus for me. As long as these knives keep their sharp edge, this will be my new go to set. This also would make a great gift to almost anyone whether house warming, wedding, birthday or just because. My husband thought the chopping board is too small for most needs but I told him that most of my chopping is indeed on this size and pulled out my little chopping board hat I use most and showed him 2 larger sizes I have when I need those.

They are lighter in weight and thickness than most knives I have used, but they are sturdy and the blades are rigid enough for good control.  They have a good, sharp edge.  The block and cutting board are all bamboo, which is hard and durable.  I believe the knives, the block and the cutting board will serve me well for many years.  I like the narrow footprint of the set; they don't use much counter space and they keep the knives handy.  Overall, this is an excellent set for the price.",0,Ease of use
2023-01-11,Design Just Doesn't Work,3.0,"Oddly, I chose this because it was very different in style than most knife blocks and looked interesting. In practice, though - it does not work. I need to place this under a cabinet and the way the knives are inserted make it too tall and you have to pull it our from under the cabinet to get a knife out. I ended up keeping the knives and getting a different block.",1,Stain resistance
2023-01-14,Very Lightweight Because Handles I Think Are Plastic,4.0,"This knife block set was valued at $40, so basing my review on that price I would give it about a 4-star overall rating and for value for money and 3 stars for sturdiness. The reason for the 4-star ratings on these features is because the knife handles are extremely light, and I think they are plastic made to look like steel and the block section that holds the knives is wobbly/not sturdy. However, I give these a 5-star rating for easy to clean. The design is great because this butcher block knife holder takes up less space than the typical butcher block knife holder, and the added cutting board is a bonus because it is readily available and in a convenient space. The wood seems to be quality as well.I think this company has a really great idea and design, I just think the manufacture needs to put a little better quality into the material of the knives and sturdiness of the block itself.",1,Stain resistance
2023-01-15,Good deal on a knife set,4.0,"All of these knives work well.  You get a lot of knives, a potato peeler, cutting board, and knife sharpener.  The price is good for all that you get.",0,Value
2023-01-15,"Good set without steak knives, less space",4.0,"I was looking for a knife set that doesn't have steak knives as I don't need those. I was really happy with the design of this as it saves a lot of space. I have it snugged up against the side of my microwave and I've been really happy with this layout.When I first unpacked and washed the knives I was a little concerned about how light they are. I figured they would end up breaking or just being overall trash. But I have been using them for almost a month. I use at least one of the knives on a daily basis and they are sturdy. I haven't had a single issue - which surprised me.The cutting board is too small for my ""prep"" so I still use my old one. I measured this one and it's 11.5"" x 9.75"" on the un-grooved side. The grooved side has less than 9x9"" on it's side. I prefer the grooved side for doing melons and there's no way I could safely chop a melon up on that little space. It IS incredibly convenient for slicing a bagel in the morning (the bread knife in the set is my favorite. Those serrated teeth are hardcore compared to my other similar knife). I can easily grab the cutting board to chop lettuce for my turtle, set it out with sliced citrus fruits for drinks, and other small jobs. The cutting board is sturdy and held right on the knife block so, even though it's small, I am still happy it's there.The ""sharpener"" is not something I will use. If you are reading this...you probably don't want to either. This thing is like a rasp for shoeing horses. I will stick to my little handheld sharpener. I am afraid using that thing would completely ruin my knives.I don't know how long this set will last, but I am a vegetarian so I don't need ""meat quality"" knives and these are sharp and light. I am happier with this than I first thought I would be. It's definitely a good set.",0,Cover

2023-01-19,Knives arrived sharpened and ready to go. One piece construction,4.0,"I find that the easiest way to test knives for sharpness is the tomato test: using a regular, not serrated, knife, see if you can easily cut a tomato. As you can see from the picture above, these knives easily passed that test. They came sharpened and ready for use (after washing).The other nice thing about these knives is that the blade and handles are all of one piece. That means you don't need to worry about the blade coming loose later because of dried-out glue or a loosened tang.The knife holder is funky, holding the knives at an angle. That can be good or bad, space-wise, depending on where you place it and how much room you have.The cutting board is small, for my taste. I do like that it's double-sided, with one side having a groove around it to contain juices that might otherwise flow out onto the counter. But the board (for me) wasn't the main impetus for the buy, it was a nice extra thrown in.",1,Sharpness

2023-08-27,Neat little set!,3.0,"Update: knives are terrible- do not recommend for avid cooks only for  those who will use minimally and perhaps beginners - dorm rooms , 1st apartments perhaps - For advanced and detailed cooking , especially when they’re going to be used repetitively- the knives are not high-quality enough and could potentially become dangerous , - I stand by them being fantastic for cleanliness , space saving , gift set to someone just starting out .  I am oI cook a lot, and am constantly dicing and slicing vegetables and fruit, so I am little underwhelmed when there are so many knives and I am limited to so few for certain tasks. I grab my other favorites when necessary. The quality of this set in my opinion is more focused on its compact design which I love , as well as no potential for the common mildew ( to house the knives) and so much less potential to rust, as this material is highly sustainable.  I put the cutting board on top of my wooden one which Is so convenient and has been a huge bonus ! - The knife sharpener is a nice touch of course . Over all this is a very well rounded set , however keep in mind you are not getting professional knives, and for many , the high quality sharp blade you are looking for . However, this set will get the job done - and is a great space saver as well as a clean and sanitary way to keep your kitchen cooking !",1,Value

Right out of the box I did the paper cut test on the 5 inch paring knife. It did not cut the paper, but after giving it a few swipes with the included sharpener rasp, it did! So you may want to give the knives a quick sharpening with the tool before use.I like this set because, A. They are one piece, no wood, no plastic to hold dirt or chip off, or even break off, also no rivits to contend with.B. No steak knives, it seems every set on Amazon comes with all those steak knives, and I don't want them, plus I don't eat steak.C. Nice natural finish, no red, green or black knives for me, give me a shiney metal knife.And D. The price!! I got these on the cyber Monday deal. They claim they retail for $60, but I think I got these for $23 and change.  Just can't beat that, because some knives are very overpriced, (like the Wusthof set).  So for now, and some may argue with me, but they compare to the sharpness of the Wusthof set, that will be staying in the kitchen. Thanks. Kem.12/4/23",1,Quality

The handle is building up some green moss or something like what you see in bathroom tiles. Blade is still sharp though. Maybe it's incorrect maintenance of the knives, not sure but here is my feedback after a year of use. Thanks!",0,Size
